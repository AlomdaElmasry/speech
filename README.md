My approach to the kaggle speech recognition challenge,

see my blog post at: https://dinantdatascientist.blogspot.dk/2018/02/kaggle-tensorflow-speech-recognition.html

In this repo I have implementations of a ResNet and a CTC speech-to-text model.
Start with the preproc notebook to get the training and validation arrays. Then train.ipynb.

You will need a data/ graphs/ logs/ and models/ directory for the save files.
